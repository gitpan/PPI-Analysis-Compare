NAME
    PPI::Analysis::Compare - Compare two perl documents for equivalence

SYNOPSIS
      use PPI::Analysis::Compare;
  
      # Compare my file to yours, to see if they are functionally equivalent
      PPI::Analysis::Compare->compare( 'my/file.pl', 'your/file.pl' );

DESCRIPTION
    The module is part of PPI, but is provided seperately, as is the
    practice for any non-essential module with additional dependencies.

    The PPI::Analysis::Compare module takes to perl documents, as a file
    name, raw source or an existing PPI::Tokenizer or PPI::Document object,
    and compares the two to see if they are functionally identical.

    The two documents (however they are provided) are loaded into fully
    lexed PPI::Document structures. These are then destructively modified to
    factor out anything that may have different content but be functionally
    equivalent.

    Initially, this means that all non-significant items, such as
    whitespace, comments, POD, __END__ and __DATA__ sections etc are
    stripped out of the structs. Finally a deep Data::Compare is used to
    check that the two sets of lexed code are identical.

    Currently, the default set of transforms include removal of
    non-signicant content, such as whitespace, pod, __END__ and __DATA__
    sections, etc. It also includes some transforms to change => to , and
    remove empty statements.

METHODS
  compare $left, $right, option => value, ...
    For the time being, PPI::Analysis::Compare provides only the "compare"
    method. The first two arguments are the left and right comparitors.

    Each comparitor can be either a PPI::Document or PPI::Tokenzier object,
    a file name, or a reference to a scalar containing raw perl source code.
    Each comparitor will be loaded, tokenized and lexed as needed to get two
    PPI::Document objects for comparison.

    The list of options will be documented once this module is actually
    useful.

TO DO
    Document the extention mechanism, and maybe autodetect plugins?
